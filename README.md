# My Journey Planner

A python GUI project with implementation of advanced Data Structures and Algorithm.

## Topic : Designing, developing and testing a journey planner model for a hypotheical Underground train network.

### Description :
The City Underground tube system is a complex interconnection of stations across the
city area. You are provided with a standard map in pdf format that depicts the network. You may assume that the trains operate from 05:00 until midnight each day. You may assume that there is no difference between peak times
and off-peak times and that the trains run every 5 minutes with a 1 minute stop at each
station to allow passengers to (dis)embark. The travel times taken between any two
successive stations is determined already based on previously collected data and is provided
in the accompanying excel spreadsheet called “City Underground Data.xlsx”. 

This data :

1. has not been quality checked and may contain errors or omissions. You are to decide
how you will report and act on these as part of your study.
2. does not include the waiting time at a station or the (dis)embarking of passengers.
Your team have been asked to provide a model software solution for a route planner of the
City Underground tube system for use by the general public. For a Basic Solution you
should provide a model that will determine the solution for the quickest journey time and
you should carefully consider the design, implementation and testing of the software using
appropriate or stated technology.

## Data Structures Used : Double Linked List
The Data Structure to hold data of diffrent stations should be in the for of Double Linked List.

## Algorithm Used : Dijkstra Algorithm
To Compute shortest distance between the two user entered stations, Dijkstra Algorithm should be employed.
